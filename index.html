<p>I like nature and hiking. </p>
<p>I really enjoy going on walks becuase I love being outside. I prefer to travel to places that have a green view because i am only use to seeing the desrt and strange rocks.</p>
<p>Something else that I enjoy doing is hanging out with my friends and family because it is always laughs when I am around them. I also have family in Mexico and they play a big role in my life.</p>
<p> Over the years, I have had the opportunity to visit them more often, they always know how to have a good time and create beautiful memories.</p>

<h2>It's a nice view...</h2>
